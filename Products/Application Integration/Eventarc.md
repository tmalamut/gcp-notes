# Eventarc

### Definitions
* Event-driven Cloud Run services
* Lets you asynchronously deliver events from Google services, SaaS, and your own apps using loosely coupled services that react to state changes.
* Requires no infrastructure management - you can optimize productivity and costs while building a modern, event-driven solution.
* An event is a data record expressing an occurrence and its context.
    * Is a discrete unit of communication, independent of other events.
    * Ex: Might be a change to data in a database, a file added to a storage system, or a scheduled job.

### When To Use
* Use case examples:
    * Install a config management tool on a new VM as soon as it is started
    * Detect if a service is not responding properly and automatically restart it
    * Activate an employee badge as soon as as a new employee joins a company.
