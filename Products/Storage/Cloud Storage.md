# Cloud Storage

### Definitions
* Multi-class multi-region object storage
* Allows world-wide storage and retrieval of any amount of data at any time.
* Is a service for storing your objects in Google Cloud.
    * An object is an immutable piece of data consisting of a file of any format. 
    * Can store objects in containers called buckets. 
        * All buckets are associated with a project, and you can group your projects under an organization.

### Use Cases
* Stream videos
* Image and web asset libraries
* Data lakes
* Distributing large data objects to users via direct download

### Cloud Storage Hierarchy
* Organization: Your company creates a Google Cloud org
* Project: Your company is building several apps, and each one is associated with a project. Each project has its own set of Cloud Storage APIs, as well as other resources.
* Bucket: Each project can contain multiple buckets, which are containers to store your objects. For example, you might create a photos bucket for all the image files your app generates and a separate videos bucket.
* Object: An individual file.
