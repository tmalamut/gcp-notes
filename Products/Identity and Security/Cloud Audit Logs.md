# Cloud Audit Logs

### Definitions
* GCP services write audit logs that record admin activities and accesses within your resources.
* Audit logs help you answer "who did what, where, and when?" within your resources with the same level of transparency as in on-prem environments.
* [GCP services with audit logs](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/audit/services) - All GCP services will eventually provide audit logs
* Types of audit logs:
    * Admin Activity: Contain log entries for API calls or other actions that modify the configuration or metadata of resources.
    * Data Access: Contain API calls that read the configuration or metadata of resources, as well as user-driven API calls that create, modify, or read user-provided resource data.
    * System Event: Contain log entries for actions that modify the configuration of resources. Are generated by Google systems; they aren't driven by direct user action.
    * Policy Denied: Recorded when a service denies access to a user or service account because of a security policy violation.
