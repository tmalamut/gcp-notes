### Definitions
* App latency insights
* Helps you understand how long it takes your app to handle incoming requests from users or other apps, and how long it takes to complete operations like RPC calls peformed when handling the requests

### Use Cases
* Can help you answer the following questions:
    * Why is it taking my application so long to handle a request?
    * Why do some of my requests take longer than others?
    * What is the overall latency of requests to my application?
    * Has latency for my application increased or decreased over time?
    * What can I do to reduce application latency?
    * What are my application's dependencies?
