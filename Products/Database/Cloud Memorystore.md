# Cloud Memorystore

## Memorystore for Redis + Memcached

### Definitions
* Provides a fully-managed service that is powered by the Redis in-memory data store to build app caches that provide sub-millisecond data access

### Use Cases
* Cache is an integral part of modern app architectures.
    * Provides low latency access and high throughput for heavily accessed data, compared to accessing the data from a disk based backend store.
    * Session management, frequently accessed queries, scripts, and pages are common examples of caching.
* Streaming processing: Whether processing a Twitter feed or stream of data from IoT devices, Memorystore for Redis can fit those use cases.
    * Provides a scalable, fast in-memory store for storing intermediate data that thousands of clients can access with very low latency
