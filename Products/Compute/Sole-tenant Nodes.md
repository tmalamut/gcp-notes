* Lets you have exclusive access to a sole-tenant node, which is a physical Compute Engine server that is dedicated to hosting only your project's VMs.

* Following types of workloads might benefit from using sole-tenant nodes:
    * Gaming workloads with performance requirements
    * Finance or healthcare workloads with security and compliance requirements
    * Machine learning, data processing, or image rendering workloads.
    * Workloads requiring increased input/output operations per second (IOPS) and decreased latency, or workloads that use temporary storage in the form of caches, processing space, or low-value data.
