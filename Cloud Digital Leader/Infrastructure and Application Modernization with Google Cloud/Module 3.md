### Legacy System Challenges
* A legacy system is outdated computing software and/or hardware that is still in use.
* Weren't developed to support the implementation and adoption of modern technologies such as the cloud, Internet of Things, or mobile apps.
* Were developed for a time when data was shared in batches or at specific time intervals.

### How APIs Can Modernize Legacy Systems
* APIs enable integration between systems so businesses can unlock value and create new services.
* Do this by exposing data in a way that protects the integrity of the legacy systems and enables secure and govern access to the underlying data.
* A way to build long term flexibility so an org can meet evolving needs.

### Using APIs to Create New Business Value
* A digital ecosystem is a group of interconnected companies and products.
    * Includes vendors, third party suppliers, customers, and apps.
* Example: Walgreens built the photo printing API to allow developers who are building mobile apps to connect to Walgreens to print out photos. 

### Apigee
* As a company's digital ecosystem becomes more complex, the required time and effort to manage hundreds of APIs securely and at scale becomes costly.
* The Apigee platform includes an API Services layer that provides the runtime API gateway functionality.
* Includes developer services so that a developer can access a portal to utilize your APIs for their project.
* Can also register their apps.
