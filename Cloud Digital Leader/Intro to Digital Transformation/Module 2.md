### Modernizing IT Infrastructure
* Three core focus areas for modernization: 
    * Infrastructure
    * Business platforms
    * Applications
* Infrastructure modernization is a common term used to describe the process of replacing legacy hardware and systems and consolidating them in the cloud. 
* Business critical applications are often running on existing on-prem infrastructure, so transitioning them to the cloud can be a big change.
* Most organizations want to operate a hybrid model - this means operating across multiple public cloud providers or a mixture of private on-prem and public cloud solutions. 
* Example: Businesses can take advantage of high performance computing in a cost-effective and scalable way. With cloud computing, business can scale in the cloiud and pay for what they use when they use it. 
* Example: Virtual Desktops (pre-configured images of operating systems and apps). Means that accessing the OS doesn't rely on the physical device running on the OS. Enables secure and scalable access to corporate resources.

### Modernizing Business Platforms and Applications
* Business application platforms are about enabling integration between systems and granting users the correct access privileges in an organization and beyond.
* Example: Company uses a third party platform for managing parts of customer data, customers who have purchased a premium support package should be prioritized by the partner in that region. 
    * The company uses an API to integrate their partner portal app with the customer information platform and configure it so that the partner can only access certain information and other information remains protected.
* DevOps is a set of practices that aim to increase software delivery velocity, improve service reliability, and build shared ownership among software stakeholders. 

### Unlocking the Value of Data
* Leveraging data relies on being able to capture, store, and structure it in such a way that you can make informed business decisions with it. 
* Data is no longer only about retrospective insight, it also includes real time insight, smart predictions, and intelligent action.
* With ML and AI, can generate insights from data and can also perceive, predict, recommend, and categorize data in new ways. 

### Using a New Built-In Security Model
* Traditionally, IT security models focused on keeping threats out. They built an on-prem perimeter that individuals required access to in order to gain entry. That model works when all hardware and systems were controlled and managed centrally sand employees came into the office to do their work. 
* In the cloud, the best practice for security is called a **Shared Responsibility Security Model.** 
    * The cloud provider is responsible for the physical infrastructure like the undersea cables, data centers, and the personnel to manage the hardware and software.
    * Businesses are responsible for controlling data and resource access. 

### Google Cloud Solutions for Digital Transformation
* Solution pillars:
    * Infrastructure modernization
        * Goal would be to make modifications with minimal impact to end users, learn from the updates iteratively, and ultimately meet the demands of the cloud era.
    * Business applications platform portfolio
        * Organizations can securely unlock their data with APIs, automating processes and creating applications across clouds and on-prem without coding.
        * Tools such as Apache, API Management and Cloud Endpoints, build and automate business workflows while migrating and modernizing apps as they move to the cloud or between clouds. 
    * Application modernization
        * Help businesses develop and run applications anywhere.
        * Can both modernize legacy apps and build new ones, which helps them achieve higher return on investment and innovate faster.
    * Database and storage solutions
        * Include tools that help businesses migrate and manage enterprise data with security, reliability, high availability, and fully managed data services.
        * Examples: Cloud Spanner, Cloud SQL, and Firestore.
    * Smart analytics
        * Helps businesses generate instant insights from data at any scale with a serverless fully managed analytics platform.
        * BigQuery is an industry leading example of a serverless data warehouse solution.
        * Looker is a business intelligence platform that provides a unified service to access the truest, most up to date version of your company's data.
    * Artifical intelligence
        * Tools are built to enhance innovation and improve productivity by integrating seamlessly into a company's existing workflow and products.
    * Security
        * Businesses can detect, investigate, and protect themselves against online threats before attacks result in damage or loss.
