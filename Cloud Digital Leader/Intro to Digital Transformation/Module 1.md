###  What Is The Cloud
* Is a metaphor for the network of data centers that store and compute information available through the Internet.
* Describes a complex web of software, computers, network, and security systems. 
* Example: Can map, understand, and predict human behavior, human biology, global industrial systems, and every other complex and dynamic environment.
* Enables and redefines our ability to collaborate, perceive, categorize, predict, and recommend in every industry for every activity. 

###  Paradigm Shift
* Many organizations who adopt cloud technology are seeing a shift in their costs from capital expenditure to operational expenditure.
* They're modernizing their infrastructure, solving business problems at a much faster speed, and gaining insights from their data.
* The scale and speed at which we share data has tremendously increased, and our ability to compute that data has followed an exponential curve known as Moore's Law.
* Can now build highly accurate statistical models to predict complex behaviors and use that information to anticipate intent.
* Cloud delivers high-performance analytics and enables business to reduce equipment downtime, achieve more accurate supply planning, and maintain leaner operational organizations that have more efficient systems and less waste.
* Also changes the way we work by automating processes and creating open and real-time collaboration opportunities between people globally. 

### Compute Power
* Computing is the ability to process information, to store, retrieve, compare and analyze it, and automate tasks most often done by a computer program.
* Compute power refers to the speed at which a computer is able to process data.
* Moore's Law has been disrupted twice by radical new designs in chips.
    * The first disruption comes from processors that are specifically meant for this type of application and which we call TPUs (tensor flow processing units)
    * According to Moore's Law, TPUs should be twice as powerful as the preceding units, but they're not - they are 50 times more powerful than traditional chips.
    * The second disruption comes from quantum computing, which is a hundred million times more powerful. 
  * Impact of TPUs (tensor flow processing units):
      * Machine Learning: A way of training a computer to automatically do something using lots of data.
      * A ML model that would require a day of training with traditional processors only requires half an hour of training with TPUs. 
      * TPUs need to be cooled with pressurized water within the chip.

### Data as Currency
* With cloud computing, can provide both input and output data side-by-side and generate a trained algorithm.
    * Means it uses a combination of existing input and output data to learn the correct outcome when faced with information it hasn't encountered before. Referred to as self-learning.
        * Example: In an image-recognition app like Google Photos, you can provide your photos, the input, and the correct identifier of the person in the photo, so the output. Then, you can train the image-recognition algorithm embedded in the app to automatically recognize and categorize new photos even if their appearance goes through significant changes over time. 
        * Example: Social media apps - embedded ML algorithm is learning from the profiles you visit often, your interests, locations you tag in photos, your searches, or a group that you share with someone. It then compiles a recommended list of people that you may what you become friends with. The accuracy and performance of the algorithm is also based on the millions of users that the algorithm is constantly learning from.
