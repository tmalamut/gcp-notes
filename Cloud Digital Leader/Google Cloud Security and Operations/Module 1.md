### Cloud Cost Management
* For orgs that build and deploy apps on-prem, there's a heavy emphasis on capital expenditure (CapEx) to setup and maintain their IT infrastructure. 
* When an org migrates or builds and deploys apps using cloud services, there's a greater emphasis on operational expenditure (OpEx).
* Because of the variable nature of cloud resources and their costs, spending must be monitored and controlled on an ongoing basis.
* For large orgs, the finance team needs to take on a financial planning and advisory role.
    * Need to understand their org's business priorities, then make data-driven decisions around cloud spending.
* To manage cloud costs effectively, a partnership across finance, tech, and business functions is required.
* When it comes to cloud cost management, consider the questions:
    * What are the associated resource costs?
    * How do these costs measure against the broader business strategy?

### Total Cost of Ownership
* The total cost of ownership refers to a comprehensive assessment of all of the layers within the infrastructure and other associated costs across the business over time.
* Includes acquiring hardware and software, management and support, communications, user expenses, cost of service downtime, training, and other productivity losses.

### Best Practices for Managing Google Cloud Costs
* Orgs need to identify the individual or team that manage costs.
    * If it's a team, it should ideally be a mix of IT managers and financial controllers.
* Important to understand what kind of information can be found in an invoice versus cost management tools.
    * An invoice and Google Cloud tools are not the same thing. 
    * An invoice tells you how much you're spending over a period of time.
    * Cost management tools are more effective for answering the why.
* Orgs can use cost management tools for accountability and to gain visibility, control, and intelligence.
* Can use Google Cloud built-in reporting tools and create custom dashboards to gain greater visibility into their costs. 
    * Team should review these reports at least weekly.
* The pricing calculator allows an org to see how changing usage will affect their costs.
