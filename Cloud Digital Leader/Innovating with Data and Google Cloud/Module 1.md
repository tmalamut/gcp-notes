### The Role of Data in Digital Transformation
* Data is any information that is useful to an organization. 
* As organizations have digitized their operations, all kinds of business data has become available, such as financial information, logistics data, production output, and quality reports. 
* Large enterprises with traditional IT infrastructures face several limitations in leveraging the value of data.
    * Processing volumes and varieties of new data, either at regular time intervals known as batch or in real time.
    * Finding cost-effective solutions for setting up and maintaining data centers. 
    * Scaling resource capacity up or down, and regulating their capacity globally, especially during peak demand times throughout the year.
* Public cloud services offer organizations economies of scale, rapid elasticity, and automation where there was manual overhead.
    * Allow organizations to bring together data points and platforms fragmented across their whole ecosystem. 

### Leveraging Data
* A data map is a chart of all the data used in end-to-end business processes.
* Customer purchasing an item is a data point.
* Aggregating that data point with other purchases across stores in each region results in another type of data: transactions. This is a dataset. 
* User data: Contains all data from customers who use or purchase services and products.
* Operational data: Staffing levels in each story, stock delivery dates.
* Corporate data: About the company such as sales patterns and operations. 
* Industry data: Found outside an individual organization that everyone in the sector needs to view or access to gain knowledge about a specific domain.

### Data Types
* Categorize data in two main types: structured and unstructured.
* Structured data is highly organized.
    * Examples include customer records consisting of names, addresses, credit card numbers, and other quantitative data.
    * Can be easily stored and managed in databases.
* Unstructured data has no organization and tends to be qualitative.
    * Examples include word processing documents, audio files, images, and videos.
    * Can be stored as objects, which consists of the data itself, a variable amount of metadata, and a globally unique identifier.
    * Some unstructured data can be stored in a format called a BLOB.
        * Binary Large Object
        * Images, audio, and multimedia files can all be stored as BLOBs.
* Organizations rely on both structured and unstructured data to gain insight and make intelligent decisions. 
* Businesses can extract value from unstructured data by using an API to create structure.
    * An API is a set of functions to integrate different platforms with different types of data so that new insights can be uncovered.

### Important Data Considerations
* Personal or sensitive data about a customer or an employee needs to be securely collected, encrypted when stored in the cloud, and protected from external threats.
* Only a subset of users should be granted permission to view or access the private data. 
* Regional or industry-specific regulations often guide data policies.
