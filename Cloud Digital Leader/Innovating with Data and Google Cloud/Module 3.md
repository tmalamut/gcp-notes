### What is Machine Learning
* Need to define artifcial intelligence first:
    * A broad field or term that describes any kind of machine capable of acting autonomously.
* Machine learning is a branch within AI.
* Refers to computers that can learn from data without using a complex set of rules.
* A way to use standard algorithms or standard models to analyze data in order to derive predictive insights and make repeated decisions at scale.
    * Essentially, a way of teaching a computer how to solve problems by feeding it examples of the correct answers.
 * Need to train ML model with lots of high quality data to generate accurate and meaningful predictions.

### Data Quality
* The best data has three qualities: 
    * Has coverage
        * Refers to the scope of a problem domain and all possible scenarios it can account for.
        * All possible input and output data.
    * Clean or consistent
        * Sometimes called data consistency.
        * Make sure all data is in the same format (i.e., timestamps in the same format).
    * Complete
        * Refers to the availability of sufficient data about the world to replace human knowledge. 

### AI and ML with Google Cloud
* Provide the options to use a pretrained ML model using Google's data such as Vision API, train an existing ML model with your own data, and build a custom ML model and train it using your own data. 
* Google Cloud AI Platform is a unified simply-managed platform that makes ML easy to adopt by analysts and developers. 
    * Provides modern ML services with the ability to generate your own tailored models and use pretrained models so that you can add innovative capabilities to your own applications.
    * Also includes the Google Cloud AI Hub, a hosted repo of plug-and-play AI components. Has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources.
    * TensorFlow lets developers easily build and deploy ML-powered apps. Takes advantage of tensor processing units, or TPUs.
        * TPUs are hardware devices designed to accelerate ML workloads with TensorFlow by 15-30x.
        * Google Cloud makes them available in the cloud with Compute Engine virtual machines. 
        * Each cloud TPU offers large amount of performance, and because you pay only for what you use, there's no upfront capital investment required.
* Google's AI Hub provides notebook samples data scientists can use to learn about, train, and deploy the new model.
* Includes components like end-to-end AI pipelines and out-of-the-box algorithms. 
* Can integrate ML API's without data scientists. 
    * AutoML Vision API automates the training of your own custom machine learning models. 
        * Example: Can upload a custom batch of images or ingest them into AutoML Vision directly from Cloud Storage and train an image classification model.

### Real World Use Cases
   * Four common business problems:
       * Replacing or simplifying rule-based systems
       * Automating processes
       * Understanding unstructured data
       * Creating personalized customer experiences
